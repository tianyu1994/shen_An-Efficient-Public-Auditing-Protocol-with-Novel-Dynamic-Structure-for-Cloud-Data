# shen_An-Efficient-Public-Auditing-Protocol-with-Novel-Dynamic-Structure-for-Cloud-Data

（1）A public auditing scheme checks the verification for cloud storage, particularly dynamic data.

（2）The protocol for public auditing is implemented on top of Cryptography (PBC) library. Since I choosed the programming language, python,  to implement some algrithms in the protocol, I installed the charm-crypto 0.43 library on a linux system (ubuntu 16.04). You can find the charm-crypyto library here:https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=charm+crypto&submit=search



（3）The structure of project file :

+----head.py

 ----myToolBox.py
 
 ----publicParam.py
 
 ----userSecretData.py
 
 ----ShenScheme.py
 
 ----test0 ( not provided, you need to create the file)



（4）Note: 

1) The file for testing the algrithms is not provided and its path and name (test0) is used in the algrithms, so please create the file in your projects and change the file path in 'head.py' file when you run the programs.

2) the paper, "Shen et al_2017_An Efficient Public Auditing Protocol with Novel Dynamic Structure for Cloud.pdf ", describes the protocol in detail.
